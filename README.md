IMPORTANT: BOTH THE SCRIPT PIPELINE AND THE WORKSHOP ARE CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT, MEANING THERE ARE A LOT OF FEATURES THAT MIGHT NOT WORK YET. 

The following workshop is intended to allow you to run the Microresp processing pipeline, which takes spectrophotometer readings + experiment metadata as inputs and delivers microbial respiration rates for your samples as an output. The workflow is as follows:

0) Data import
1) Data processing
2) Exploratory visualisation
3) Data analysis tools
4) Statistical analyses
